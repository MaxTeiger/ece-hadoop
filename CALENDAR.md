## 1. The Hadoop ecosystem

### Lecture

Describes the crucial building blocks to handle the dramatic growth of data in the enterprise.
Starting with a cronological context, we will cover the limit of vertical growing
of Information Systems. We will present the advantages of distributed, redondant
systems for Massive Parallel Processing and the new paradigms they introduce.

### Pratical Work

Take control of Hortonworks Distribution.
Present tools for future pratical works.

## 2. HDFS, MapReduce and YARN

### Lecture

Present MapReduce pattern, the Google's Algorithm for batch processing.
Present HDFS, a distributed and redondant FileSystem.

### Pratical Work

Implement a distributed algorithm using the MapReduce pattern: 1/2

## 3. MapReduce and YARN

Present YARN, the architectural center of Hadoop.

### Pratical Work

Implement a distributed algorithm using the MapReduce pattern: 2/2

## 4. Pig

### Lecture

Present Pig, a scripting platform for processing

### Pratical Work

Write complex MapReduce transformations using a scripting language: Pig Latin.

## 5. Hive, MR and Tez

### Lecture

Present Hive, The standard for SQL queries in Hadoop.

With Hive, we will use SQL to query up-to petabytes of data.
We will also learn how to optimize your query through model design,
compression and data formatting.

### Pratical Work

TODO

## 6. ETL (Extract, Transform, load)

### Lecture

Present Sqoop, Flume and Oozie for Design and manage Workflows on Hadoop

### Pratical Work

Use Sqoop, Flume and Oozie to place the algorithm from session 2 and 3 inside a larger workflow.

## 7. HBase

### Lecture

Present HBase: A NoSQL database on top of HDFS

### Pratical Work

Build a short Java Project with the fast column family store as a backend using
HBase API.

## 8. Lambda architecture with Spark

### Lecture

Present Spark: In-memory compute for Data Science

Apache Spark brings fast, in-memory data processing to Hadoop for ETL, Machine Learning
and Data Science.

### Pratical Work

TODO

## 9. Kafka

### Lecture

Present Kafka: A fast, scalable, fault-tolerant messaging system

In a modern data architecture built on YARN-enabled Apache Hadoop, Kafka works
in combination with Flume/Storm, Apache HBase and Apache Spark for real-time
analysis and rendering of streaming data

### Pratical Work

Build short Demo using Kafka as a Bus.

## 10. Final Exam

Preparation to Final Exam

## Notes

All courses will take place in "Labo Linux User".
