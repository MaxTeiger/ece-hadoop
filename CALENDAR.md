## 1. The Hadoop ecosystem

### Lecture

Describes the crucial building blocks to handle the dramatic growth of data in the
enterprise. Starting with a cronological context, we will cover the limit
of vertical growing of Information Systems.
We will present the advantages of distributed, redondant
systems for Massive Parallel Processing and the new paradigms they introduce.

### Pratical Work

Present environment and tools for future pratical works.

## 2. HDFS and MapReduce

### Lecture

Present MapReduce, the Google's algorithm for batch processing.
Present HDFS, a distributed and redondant FileSystem.

### Pratical Work

Implement a distributed algorithm using the MapReduce pattern: 1/2

## 3. MapReduce and YARN

Present YARN, the architectural center of Hadoop.

### Pratical Work

Implement a distributed algorithm using the MapReduce pattern: 2/2

## 4. High Level MapReduce: Pig & Hive

### Lecture

Present Pig, a scripting platform for processing
Present Hive, The standard for SQL-like queries in Hadoop.

We will also learn how to optimize your query through model design,
compression and data formatting.

### Pratical Work

Write complex MapReduce transformations using :
* SQL-Like queries (Hive)
* a scripting language (Pig Latin).

## 5. ETL (Extract, Transform, load)

### Lecture

Present Sqoop, Flume and Oozie for Design and manage Workflows on Hadoop

### Pratical Work

Mid-Term Exams

## 6. HBase

### Lecture

Present HBase: A NoSQL database on top of HDFS

### Pratical Work

Build a short Java project with the fast column family store as a backend using
HBase API.

## 7. Spark

### Lecture

Present Spark: In-memory compute for Data Science

Apache Spark brings fast, in-memory data processing to Hadoop for ETL, Machine
Learning and Data Science.

### Pratical Work

Use the Spark Shell to experiment a functional (and object-oriented) language: Scala

## 8. Kafka

### Lecture

Present Kafka: A fast, scalable, fault-tolerant messaging system

In a modern data architecture built on YARN-enabled Apache Hadoop, Kafka works
in combination with Flume/Storm, Apache HBase and Apache Spark for real-time
analysis and rendering of streaming data

### Pratical Work

Build short Demo using Kafka as a Bus.

## 9. Lambda architecture

### Lecture

Present the Lambda architecture, to perform both real-time and batch processing

### Practical Work

Preparation to Final Exams.
In this pratical class, we return to the concepts that have been misunderstood.

## 10. Final Exam

Final Exam

## Notes

All courses will take place in "Labo Linux User".
